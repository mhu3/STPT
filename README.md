# STPT

we are inspired by the success of the pre-trained language models to train a spatial-temporal pre-trained model using self-supervised learning. 
Such a model extracts knowledge from diverse HSTD (\eg, GPS traces, transportation data, mobile phone data), and can be fine-tuned and applied to various downstream applications (\eg, human verification and identification, traffic forecast, and human mobility analysis) given a small number of training data (for fine-tuning) as is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:foundation}.
% 
We thus introduce the \underline{S}patial-\underline{T}emporal \underline{P}re-{T}raining model, \ie, STPT, to generate robust and generic representations from HSTD using our novel self-supervised learning approach.
